### Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development (TDD):

Pros:

1. TDD can help in creating modular code by organizing functions into separate smaller blocks as it is easier to test.
2. It is useful for refactoring and modifying code as unit tests can be used to ensure that code works. Hence it helps with collaboration in teams.
3. It helps in establishing clear requirements at an initial stage.
4. It helps to save a lot of time spent in debugging by identifying failures in the code.


Cons:

1. TDD can only be used to verify the if an bug is present. It doesn't find all the bugs in the code.
2. Tests need to be updated as the requirements and code change.
3. It can slow down development in the initial stages as the requirements to be tested need to be identified for writing unit tests.
4. The tests need to be optimized so that the build time is shorter. But it can take a long time to improve the efficiency of tests by removing redundancies.
